# Issue to Beads: Task Planning

You are converting a GitHub issue into beads (tasks/features/epics).

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT ask clarifying questions. Analyze the issue and create a complete plan based on the information provided. Present your plan to the user when finished.

## GitHub Issue #{{.Number}}: {{.Title}}

**State:** {{.State}}
**Author:** {{.Author.Name}} ({{.Author.Login}})
**URL:** {{.URL}}
**Created:** {{.CreatedAt.Format "2006-01-02"}}
{{if .Labels}}**Labels:** {{range $i, $l := .Labels}}{{if $i}}, {{end}}{{$l.Name}}{{end}}{{end}}
{{if .Milestone}}**Milestone:** {{.Milestone.Title}}{{end}}
{{if .Assignees}}**Assignees:** {{range $i, $a := .Assignees}}{{if $i}}, {{end}}{{$a.Login}}{{end}}{{end}}

### Body

## Your Task

1. **Analyze** the issue above - understand the goal, scope, and requirements
   - Inspect the codebase for relevant context before creating tasks
2. **Create a top-level feature** that represents the entire issue:
   - The feature must include the GitHub issue URL
   - Use a title that reflects the issue goal
   - Include a high-level description of the feature
3. **Break down** the work into actionable tasks under that feature:
   - Each task should be completable in a single session
   - Tasks should be clear enough for someone else to pick up
   - Each task must include at least a short description of what should be done
4. **Link tasks to the feature** using `--parent` on creation (no dependency links to the feature)
5. **Assign priorities** (P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog)

## Output Format

Present your plan as:

### Summary
One paragraph describing what this issue accomplishes.

### Work Breakdown
List all items with:
- Type (feature/task)
- Title
- Priority
- Brief description
- Parent (feature id) for every task; dependencies only when tasks block other tasks

### Commands
The exact `bd` commands to create everything:

```bash
# Create items
bd create --title="..." --type=feature --priority=...
bd create --title="..." --type=task --priority=... --parent <feature-id>

# Set dependencies (only between tasks when needed)
bd dep add <task-id> <dependency-id>
```

Wait for user confirmation before running any commands.
